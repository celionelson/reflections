When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> When collaborating with other people for a project. Then everybody working on that project can add their changes to the code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> If there are significant changes (or even tiny ones) made by others, that are automatically synced to the local directory, it might cause trouble when I start working on it again. I'd rather pull the changes manually.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--> Forks are repositories copied from other people's GitHub to my personnal account. They're to be used when you want to start a project from another person's work (and be able to modify it), for example.
Clones are a copies of online repositories to my local directory, on my computer. They're used when you're jointly working with somebody else on a project and want to sync your changes.
Branches are different versions (or series of commits) of a file. They're used to experiment a new feature in your existing code without risking to damage the master code for example.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

--> This way, when offline, we can still compare our local version to the last known online version.
