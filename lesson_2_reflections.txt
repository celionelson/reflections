What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-> A folder named '.git' is created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

--> The staging area is where I add files from my working directory that I will commit next. It enables me to add multiple files on the staging area first and then commit (then they'll be committed together, a good thing for CSS and HTML files that are working linked together for exemple).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

--> I can compare the staged file and the last commit with "diff" to make sure I have only one logical change between them, and then commit when it's good.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

--> For exemple, when I want to experiment new features without risking to impact the code already working properly. I can then create a new branch and experiment there, and go back to master whenever needed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

--> They're a good way to now what are the parents of a commit.
