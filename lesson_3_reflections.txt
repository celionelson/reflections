When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> When collaborating with other people for a project. Then everybody working on that project can add their changes to the code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> If there are significant changes (or even tiny ones) made by others, that are automatically synced to the local directory, it might cause trouble when I start working on it again. I'd rather pull the changes manually.
